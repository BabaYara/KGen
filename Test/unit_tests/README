This is a suite of fortran language tests for KGEN development.
Each test implements a specific fortran feature and a kernel using that
feature is extracted by KGEN.

Please run make all in this directory to run all the tests available.

This is still under development. More tests will be added soon.

If a test fails, an error.log file is generated inside that test's folder. Please view that file for 
more details.
