This is a suite of fortran language tests for KGEN development.
Each test implements a specific fortran feature and a kernel using that
feature is extracted by KGEN.

Please run test.sh in this directory to run all the tests available.

This is still under development. More tests will be added and the testing scripts will be changed soon.

If a test fails, an error.log file is generated inside that test's folder. Please view that file for 
more details.

To run these tests, you need to modify test.sh inside this folder to point to the appropriate KGEN
source that you have access to.
