TL;DR
For all tests: 
"make"
For individual tests: 
"make copy"
"cd <test_name>"
"make KGEN_ROOT=../../.."

******************************************************

This is a suite of fortran language tests for KGEN development.
Each test implements a specific fortran feature and a kernel using that
feature is extracted by KGEN.

Please run make in this directory to run all the tests available.

This is still under development. More tests will be added soon.

If a test fails, an error.log file is generated inside that test's temp folder tmp_test*/.
Please view that file for more details.

To run individual tests, please first run "make copy" in this directory. This will 
generate a set of individual test temp folders. You can then go inside whichever test you
wish to run and do a "make" in that folder. In this case, you will have to explicitly pass
the value of KGEN_ROOT as an argument to make. Have KGEN_ROOT point to your kgen source.
If you do not have a separate kgen source, this is the command to run:

"make KGEN_ROOT=../../.."
