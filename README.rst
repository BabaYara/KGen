Changes from KGEN ver. 0.6.3
----------------------------

[ User Interface ]

* Three mandatory arguments(clean, build and run of target application) are added in command line.
* strace, rebuild, prerun options are added

[ Major Improvements ]

* Macro definitions and include paths are automatically generated by KGen


Overview
--------

* KGEN extracts a Fortran subprogram as a stand-alone software out of a large software application
* In addition, it generates instrumented files that save input & output data for the generated kernel
* Correctness check and timing measurement are included in the generated kernel


Dependencies
------------

* Python (>=2.7 and < 3.0) and Python standard library
* C Pre-Processor(cpp)
* Make build tool(make)
* System call trace tool(strace)


Obtaining the Source Code
-------------------------

The latest KGEN can be obtained from the Git repository.

    git clone https://github.com/NCAR/KGen.git


Building & Installation
-----------------------

Current KGEN does not require to build or to install.


Instructions & Use
------------------

1. Download from KGen Github repository.
	>> git clone https://github.com/NCAR/KGen.git

2. Read Kgen documentation in "doc" directory under the top Kgen directory.
	>> evince KGENUsersGuideVersion0.7.0.pdf 

3. Try a kernel generation example in "example/simple" directory

	>> cd example/simple;	# move to an example directory

	>> vi src/Makefile;			# Modify FC if required

	>> make;				# extract a kernel

	>> cd kernel;		# move to a kernel directory

	>> make;				# build and run a kernel
